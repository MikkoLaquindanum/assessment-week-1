// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing and Integration
6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, which is determining the users expectations of a new product or modified project."
const design = "This is the third step, where one or more designs are created to achieve the project result."
const implementation = "This is the forth step, this includes the user training, installation of project, and the start of integrating the system into a daily work process."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, where all of the project have been fully constructed and successfully tested."
const maintain = "This is the last step, this means everything was successful with the project and fully operational. This step also includes upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the system if it breaks."
